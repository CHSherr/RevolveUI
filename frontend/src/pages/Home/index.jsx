        React apps are made out of components. A component is a piece of the UI
        (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance. A component can
        be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page. <br></br>
        <br></br> React components are JavaScript functions that return markup:
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
